# Demystifying-The-Brain
My notes and learnings from the nptel course of "Demystifying the Brain". 
This course is to help me understand the explored working of the brain and it's structure. 
Main aim is to better handle Brain related data, thus making better decisions while doing analysis on them. Also curiosity!
