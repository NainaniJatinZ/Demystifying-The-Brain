1. Right hemisphere of our brain controls the movement of left and vice versa

2. Electroencephalography (EEG) is used to show brain activity under certain psychological states, such as alertness or drowsiness. 
Positron emission tomography (PET) scans show brain processes by using the sugar glucose in the brain to illustrate where neurons are firing.

3. Cerebellum: is located under the cerebrum. Its function is to coordinate muscle movements, maintain posture, and balance.

4. occipital lobe is the visual processing area of the brain. controls visuospatial processing, depth perception, color determination, object and face recognition. 
Temporal Lobes control auditory stimuli, memory and emotion. 

5. The parietal lobe is reported to integrate information on proprioception, touch, space navigation, and language processing.

6. Nerves are bundles of axons.

7. Our nervous system is divided in two components: the central nervous system (CNS), which includes the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which encompasses nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.

8. The somatosensory system is the part of the sensory system concerned with the conscious perception of touch, pressure, pain, temperature, position, movement, and vibration, which arise from the muscles, joints, skin, and fascia.

9. A neurotransmitter molecule crosses the synaptic cleft conveying information between neurons.

10. The Basal Ganglia is involved in reward-based learning.
